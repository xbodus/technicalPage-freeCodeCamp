        <header>Early Years</header>
        <p>The orgins of the St Louis Cardinals began as the lesser known St Louis Brown Stockings. A professional ball club with a short history competing from 1875 to 1877, until a fixing scandal in 1877 got two players kicked out of the league and forced the team to go bankrupt. With Ned Cuthbert keeping the team somewhat relavent with duct tape and super glue tactics, in 1881 a German immogrant, Chris Von Der Ahe, bought the Brown Stockings ball club, shortly after renaming the team to the St Louis Browns. </p>
        <p>After some ups and downs. The Browns had some stellar years of baseball, securing 4 consecutive pennant victories and even captured a world title in the American Association to boot. In 1892 the Browns merged into the National league after the American Assoication dissolved. In 1898, Von Der Ahe after going bankrupt sold the team to new owners Frank and Stanley Robinson. The Robinson's began having the team wear red and renamed the team to the Perfectos. However, legend has it after a reporter overhead a lady regard the new team colors as "a lovely shade of cardinal" and reported on it. A cord was struck with the owners and soon after the team was renamed to the St Louis Cardinals. </p>
        <p>The team shifted owners a few more times before under the helm of general manager/vice president Branch Rickey and owner Sam Breadon the team reached a new level. Branch was able to garner talented players for the team from an idea he had called the "farm system", the first of its kind. A system so successful it was adopted by every other team in the MLB. Soon with their leadership the team was able to conduct itself in the winning ways the franchise is known for.</p>

        <h3>Notable Players</h3>
        <p><strong>Stan "The Man" Musial</strong>, also known as "baseball's perfect warrior", kept his high play on and off the field. A product of Rickey's farm sytem, Musial's legendary career was awarded with being an all-star 24 time, a world champion 3 times, an mvp 3 times, and even a statue infront of Busch Stadium.  </p>
        <p><strong>Bob Gibson</strong>, pitcher extrodiar. In his career, Gibson had a win-loss record of 251-174 with an ERA of 2.91, during a stretch in 1968 holding a 1.12 era for the season.

        <p><strong>Ozzie "The Wizard of Oz" Smith</strong>, known for the excitement he brought to the field with his signature backflip. As a career short stop his highlights speak for themselves. He was a 15 time all-star, a world champion, a 13 time gold glove winner, and even an MVP.</p>
        <p><strong>Mark McGwire</strong>, despite the steriods, he was a part of an extrodiary time for St Louis baseball during the 1988 home run race where McGwire hit 70 homeruns in a single season. One of the most prolific home run hitters in baseball history, McGwire hit 583 home runs, which ranked 5th-most in MLB history at the time of his retirement and currently ranks 11th. He holds the major-league career record for at bats per home run ratio (10.6), and is the former record holder for both home runs in a single season (70 in 1998) and home runs hit by a rookie (49 in 1987).</p>
        <p><strong>Albert "The Machine" Pujols</strong>,  Pujols was pivitol for the Cardinals most recent World titles (2006, 2011). He was the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2005, 2008, and 2009 and is an 11-time All-Star (2001, 2003â€“2010, 2015, 2022). He is a six-time Silver Slugger who has twice led the NL in home runs, and he has also led the NL once each in batting average, doubles, and runs batted in (RBIs).

        <h2></h2>
        <div>
        <p>As the Cardinals enter into a new era after the loss of key Cardinal members who helped grab world titles in <em>2006</em> and <em>2011</em> such as Tony LaRoussa, Yadi Molina, Albert Pujols, and now Adam Wainwright, there is undoubtedly many bumps in the road ahead. However, the passing of the torch is not without some light at the end of the tunnel. A budding star on the team, <strong>Jordan Walker</strong> shows excellent talent for the game, and showed strong production for the team in his rookie year. With over 100 years in the league, the Red Birds are no strangers to rebuilding, and that experience will be valuable navigating this rebuilding period. Surely they will get back to their winning ways soon enough. Until then, we wait to see what they do!</p>
